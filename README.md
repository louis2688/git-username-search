### What was the project about?

Project was built with React, Redux and other tools use to search username in github to view list of repos linked to readme page. Requests are cached in session storage to limit the use of API

### How to run locally:

### $ ` git clone `
### $ ` yarn `
### $ ` yarn start `

### App will run on **http://localhost:3001/**

Note:
There is API limit because Github has strict limit request. To increase the limit you may export personall token at https://github.blog/2013-05-16-personal-api-tokens/ to excrease limit access.

then export your token in terminal 

### $ ` export USER_SEARCH_OAUTH = {token} `
